# Stables

> **Money that is truly yours. Secure, Pseudonymous and Unstoppable.**

Stables is a global money platform designed for everyone. Built on the **[Minima](https://minima.global)** network, it provides universal access to stable value without traditional intermediaries, ensuring your money remains under your absolute control at all times.

## The Vision

We believe that financial freedom should not be a privilege. Stables leverages the power of Minima to create a payment system that is:

*   **Secure**: Your assets are protected by the fundamental principles of a truly decentralized network.
*   **Pseudonymous**: Privacy is a right. Transact freely without compromising your personal identity.
*   **Unstoppable**: Designed to be resilient, borderless, and always accessible, no matter where you are in the world.

## Project Status

The Stables platform is currently under active development by the **Council**. We are committed to a transparent, step-by-step disclosure of our progress as we move toward a global launch.
